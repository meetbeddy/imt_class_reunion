              Precisely on 14 October, 2015 some class members of 2002 Institute
              of Management and Technology (IMT) Set decided to create a social
              media group - WhatsApp on the basis of fostering a continued
              relationship amongst those who entered and registered into the
              Department of Accountancy in 1997/1998 session and all those who
              joined the class in 2000/2001 session (not excluding class members
              who left for other schools through Direct Entry or those who did
              not graduate in year 2002). The theme is open source, and you can
              use it for any purpose, personal or commercial.
            </p>
            <p className="text-white">
              To set the records straight, it was agreed that we should not use
              word alumni/alumnus/alumna as this will exclude all those that did
              not graduate in year 2002 or those who left after the National
              Diploma Programme. With the above in mind, we chose to use the
              word “SET” instead of “ALUMNI/ALUMNUS/ALUMNA”. The idea is
              generally premised on carrying all our classmates and friends
              along – the more, the merrier.

              In furtherance to this course, the group has since metamorphosed
              into a physical group with Enugu as the pioneer and mother branch.
              Precisely on the 23rd of January, 2022 the pioneer President of
              the Association – Stephen Ebialim Ndili, FCA inaugurated Lagos
              branch and at the same venue and date commissioned the Committee
              on Entrepreneurship and Benevolent Fund with Chizoba Onyebuchi,
              FCA as Chairman.

              At the conclusion of deliberations at the general WhatsApp group,
              it was unanimously agreed that activities of the class should be
              formalized by:

              It is on this backdrop that the group agreed a preferred name -
              Institute of Management and Technology (IMT) Accountancy 2002 Set
              Association (in brief, IMT Accountancy 2002 Set Association). In
              agreeing the name, consideration was given to the registration
